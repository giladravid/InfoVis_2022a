### What is Perception?
Perception - The process of recognizing (being aware of), organizing (gathering and storing), and interpreting (binding to knowledge) sensory information.

The process by which we interpret the world around us, forming a mental representation of the environment.

- “The visual system is not very good at being a physical light meter, but that is not its purpose.” (Adelson, 1995)
---
### Physiology
The main sensory component is to form 2d on the photoreceptors.

photoreceptors respond in the presence of photons that make up light waves

~ 380 nm - 700 nm (and shrink with age)

        - fast
        - parallel (~250 ms)
    - controlled - attentive
        - slower
        - short term memory
        - selective

combination on nonunique features normally cannot be detected preattentively

---
### Tips
- Harness low-level visual system during visualization
    - draw attention to areas of potential interest
- visual features assigned to data attributes can take advantage
- align to users needs
- must not produce visual interference that masks information

---
### Preattentive Features

length, width, size, orientation, curvature, number, terminators, intersection

### Feature Integration Theory - Treisman
- Detected preattentive features
    - target detection
    - boundary detection
    - measured response time and accuracy
- How the human visual system performs preattentive processing
![](https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/PP/figs/hue_boundary.gif) ![](https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/PP/figs/conjoin_boundary.gif)

- some preattentive features are asymmetric
---
### Feature Integration Theory - Treisman (2)
![](https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/PP/figs/feature_map.gif)
---
### Texton Theory - Bella Julesz
- detects a group of features called textons
    - elongated blob with specific properties
    - terminators
    - crossing
- Only difference in textons or their density can be detected preattentively

![](https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/PP/figs/texton_grid.gif)
---
### Similarity Theory
- Quinlan & Humphreys
- investigated conjunction searches
    1. search time may depend on the number of items of information required to identify the target
    2. search time may depend on how easily a target can be distinguished from its distractors, regardless
of the presence of unique preattentive features.
- search time is based on T-N similarity and N-N similarity
    - T-N + | efficiency - | search time +
    - N-N - | efficiency - | search time +
    - N-N - && T-N~0 --> little effect
    - T-N + && N-N>>0 --> little effect
    
![](https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/PP/figs/N-N-high.gif)   ![](https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/PP/figs/N-N-lo.gif)
---
### Similarity Theory
1. The visual field is segmented into hierarchical structural units. Individual structural units share some common properties (e.g., spatial proximity, hue, shape, motion). This segmentation process occurs in parallel.
2. visual short-term memory is limited. A template of the information being sought is available. Each structural unit is compared to this template. The better the match, the more resources allocated to the given structural unit relative to other units with a poorer match.
3. Because units are grouped in a hierarchy, a poor match between the template and a structural unit allows efficient rejection of other units that are strongly grouped to the rejected unit.
---
### Guided Search Theory - Jeremy Wolfe
- An activation map based on both bottom-up and top-down information is constructed during visual search
- Attention is drawn to peaks in the activation map
![](https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/PP/figs/activation_map.gif)
- Bottom-up activation follows feature categorization. measures differences between elements and neighbors.
- Top-down activation attempts to find items with a specific property or set of properties

---
### Boolean Map Theory -Huang et al.
- divides a visual search task into two parts: selection and access.
    - Selection involves choosing a set of objects from a scene. 
    - Access determines what properties of the selected objects a viewer can apprehend. 
    
-dividing a scene into exactly two parts: selected elements and excluded elements. This is the "boolean map".

---
### Feature Hierarchy
- One promising strategy for multidimensional visualization is to assign diﬀerent visual features
to diﬀerent data attributes.
- Interference as results from a feature hierarchy
    - boundry detection, favors color over shape
    - background variations
    - luminance over hue
    - hue over texture
- The most important data attribute (as defined by the viewer) should be displayed with the most salient visual feature.

### Change Blindness
- Human vision does not resemble the relatively faithful and largely passive process of modern photography.

- The goal of human vision is not to create a replica or image of the seen world in our heads.

- A much better metaphor for vision is that of a dynamic and ongoing construction project, where the products being built are short-lived models of the external world that are speciﬁcally designed for the current visually guided tasks of the viewer.

- There does not appear to be any general-purpose vision. 

- What we “see” when confronted with a new scene depends as much on our goals and expectations as it does on the array of
light that enters our eyes.
- "visible" and "not visible" represent two ends of a continuous spectrum.
---
### Change Blindness (2)
- The images we produce are normally novel for our viewers, so prior expectations cannot be used to guide their analyses.
Instead, we strive to direct the eye, and therefore the mind, to areas of interest or importance within a visualization. 

---
### Memory
- Sensory memory
    - High capacity
    - very fast
    - importance of positional learning
    
- Short term memory (Immediate memory)
    - limited capacity
    - high level of processing
    - less than 30 sec.
    - Miller (1956) 7 $+/-$ 2 chunks
        - we "chunk" things at the largest logical unit
        - The role of recording
    
    
- Long term memory
    - Complex
    - limitless
    - organized in complex network structure
    - accessis unreliable
    - slow

### Homan Limitations
- How many distinct line lengths and orientations can humans accurately perceive?
- How many diﬀerent sound pitches or volumes can we distinguish without error?
- What is our “channel capacity” when dealing with color, taste, smell, or any other of our senses? 
- How are humans capable of recognizing hundreds of faces and thousands of spoken words?
- What graphical entities can be accurately measured by humans?
- How many distinct entities can be used in a visualization without confusion?
- With what level of accuracy do we perceive various primitives?
- How do we combine primitives to recognize complex phenomena?
- How should color be used to present information?

### Resource Model of Human Information Processing
- Channel Capacity
    - George Miller, 1956
    - borrowed from the information theory
    - input, processing, output
    - number of levels that average human can measure with high accuracy
    - measured in bits
    - methodology: no training, avoid specialists, no context

### Error in Perception
1. position along a common scale
2. position along identical, nonaligned scales
3. length
4. angle/slope (though error depends greatly on orientation and type)
5. area
6. volume
7. color hue, saturation, density (although this was only informal testing)

.red[
- bar charts and scatterplots are effective tools for communicating quantitative data
- pie charts are probably not as eﬀective a mechanism,

---
### Weber's Law
- The likelihood of detecting a change is proportional to the relative change, not to the absolute change
- suppose $x$ is the magnitude of a physical attribute; Let $w_p(x)$ be a positive number such that the magnitude $x+w_p(x)$ is detected with probability $p$ to be differ than $x$

      $w_p(x)=k_px$

      $k_p$ does not depend on $x$

From: Teghtsoonian(1971)

### Stevens' Law
- the person's perceived scale is $p(x)=cx^\beta$ where $x$ is the magnitude of the attribute
- The perceived scale is the actual scale to a power

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens%27s_power_law
---
![](images/3_14.png)
---
### Expanding Capabilities
- reconfigure the task to require relative rather than absolute judgments
- increasing dimensionality
    - Span of perceptual dimensionality ~ 10 (Miller)
- sequence of different absolute judgments
    - absolute judgment limited by the amount of information (bits), STM by chunks
- Focus and Execution
    - If users can focus attention their performance can be improved (Chapman, 1932)
